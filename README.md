# Fluctuating-GDP-Visualization
This project visuals world GDP fluctuations before and after Covid pandemic.



This project aims to analyze the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data of various countries and compare it with the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the GDP growth. The analysis is done using Jupyter Notebook.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is acquired from [World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD), and (https://www.kaggle.com/)  . It contains the GDP data of various countries from 1960 to 2020 and GDP growth during covid pandemic.

## Libraries Used

The following Python libraries were used in this project:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- pandas_bokeh

## Analysis

The analysis is carried out in Jupyter Notebook using Python programming language. The following steps were performed:
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. Visualization of GDP trend over time
4. Comparison of GDP growth in pre-COVID vs COVID times
5. Visualization of the impact of COVID-19 on GDP growth

## Results

The analysis reveals that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the GDP growth of almost all countries. The majority of the countries have experienced a decline in GDP growth in 2020 as compared to the previous year. However, some countries have managed to maintain their GDP growth even in the COVID times.

## Conclusion

The Jupyter Notebook helped in performing a thorough analysis of the GDP data and comparison of GDP growth in pre-COVID vs COVID times. The results of the analysis can be used by policymakers to make informed decisions regarding economic recovery plans in the post-COVID era.
